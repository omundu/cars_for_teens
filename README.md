# Cars For Teens

Came across the IIHS list of what they consider [the safest cars for teens](http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicles-for-teens). In my desire to look at each car, I came up with the idea to create some sort of interface to view the cars that made the list.

Big picture to do

* [ ] Clean/Store/Format data
* [ ] Choose a presentation format for the data
* [ ] See if I can improve on the work
